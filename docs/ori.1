.TH ORI "1" "January 2013" "Ori Project" "Ori Distributed File System"
.SH NAME
ori \- Ori File System command line interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ori
\fICOMMAND\fR [\fIARGUMENTS\fR...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This tool provides the command line interface to the Ori distributed file 
system.  Provides useful tools for accessing, manipulating, and repairing Ori 
repositories without the use of FUSE.  It can be used alone without FUSE to 
checkout a snapshot of a tree and commit changes to one.  This tool is also the 
main daemon used by the SSH push/pull interface.

This command line tool also controls the Ori FUSE driver if run inside a 
mounted file system rather than a repository.  Only certain commands are 
supported at the moment and the list is documented in the orifs man page.

N.B. This project is still in flux and repository layouts may not be compatible 
between releases.  You may be required to copy files from one repository to 
another manually and the history may not be preserved.
